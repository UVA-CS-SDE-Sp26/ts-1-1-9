Program Control

After the user interacts with the CLI and User Interface parses through arguments, Program Control decides how to
proceed according to the number of arguments provided. Program control takes between 0 and 2 arguments.

Zero arguments:
When no arguments are given, the program should ask for a directory of files from the File Handler. The program should
then return a list of all available files, with the file number and associate title.

One argument:
When there is one argument given, the program should request file contents from the File Handler [validate?] using the
number of the file and provide it with a default key. Upon return of the deciphered message associated with the given
file, Program Control returns the deciphered string to User Interface. If the file number is invalid, Program Control
returns an error message.

Two arguments:
When there are two arguments given, the program should request file contents from the File Handler and provide it with a
specified alternate key to use when deciphering. If the file number or alternate key is invalid, Program Control returns
an error message. If the deciphered message is returned successfully, Program Control returns the deciphered string.



-- PSEUDOCODE --

// Upon construction of a Program Control object, method caller should specify the number of arguments and the arguments
themselves
// this can be tweaked; User Interface need not provide number of arguments; I can just figure that out

 # what do i need to understand for this program to work?
        1) which files am i to send in each case? ciphered files? deciphered files?
        2) figure out how I will receive arguments [how does CLI UI work?]
        3) how will i receive text back?
        4) how do I want to call the decipher dunction (person D's part)
        5) what fields do I need?
        6) how do I actually want to send the file itself? or read the file and then write it out again?

# tests:
- number of arguments
    - How does program responds when 0 args
        * list files available to display:
                01 filea.txt
                02 fileb.txt
                03 filec.txt
        * program exits
    - How does program responds when 1 args
        * if valid file, responds with correspondgin file text
        * program exits
    - How does program responds when 2 args
        * if valid file and key [?], responds with corresponding deciphered gile
        * program exits
    - How does program respond when >2 args
- arguments themselves
        - How does program respond if invalid args
            * error message
            * program exits
